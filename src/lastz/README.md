Users are encouraged to use a tagged release, as this working branch may not
be stable.

Additional LASTZ releases, including all releases prior to March 2017, can be

The UCSC genome browser group has included lastz and lastz_D in their prebuilt
binaries (the version there might lag behind the latest version here):

    http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/macOSX.x86_64/
```

## Install
### cmake
For some reason cmake seems to have issues with gcc so let's set the compiler to clang

CC=clang CXX=clang cmake -H. -Bbuild && cmake --build build -- -j 3

CC=clang CXX=clang cmake -DBUILD_STATIC=1 -H. -Bbuild && cmake --build build -- -j 3
